- Highlight the word or expression that you want to add

##### If you want to remove the word or expession:
- Click the icon
- Click the trash icon next to the word or expression you want to remove
- Refresh the page

# FAQS
- How many words or expressions can I add?
    - That's really a good question. I haven't tested it so if you find out please poke me.
- Can I change the color of the highlight?
    - Yes. Yes you can.
- Can I add a color for each word?
    - Not at the moment. Perhaps on the future.

    - You can fork this repo, apply your changes and then open a pull request

# Known BUGs
- Google - the extension works the first time you visit google.com but if you change your search term or switch pages it no longer works. 
- Extension popup - once you open the popup you have to click anywhere on the window to fill the color you previously selected on the color picker.
